Synopsis
--------

The purpose of this wrapper is to provide a simplified and useful engine for the extensive and complex section of the United States' National Oceanic and Atomosphic Adminstration's (NOAA) National Digital Forecast Database.

The system utilized by NOAA is a RESTful API.  While there is also a SOAP service... we are going to ignore that little feature.
